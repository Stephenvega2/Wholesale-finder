The provided Scrapy spider is designed to scrape wholesale supplier data (e.g., for GPUs, drones, or electronics) from websites, parse the data using BeautifulSoup, calculate a trust score for suppliers, store results in a SQLite database and JSON file, and display results in the terminal. It’s built for educational purposes, demonstrating web scraping, data processing, and storage techniques using Python, Scrapy, and BeautifulSoup.
Educational Note: Study the MIT License to understand open-source licensing. It encourages sharing but requires users to take responsibility for their use (e.g., legal compliance).



Learning the Code Before Trying It

To maximize educational value and ensure you understand the spider before experimenting:

Read the Code:

Start with __init__ and start_requests to understand setup and crawling.



Study parse and _extract_product_data for Scrapy/BeautifulSoup integration.



Review _calculate_trust_score and helpers to learn scoring logic.



Check _save_to_database for SQLite usage.


Break It Down:

Comment out parts (e.g., database storage) to isolate functionality:

python


# self._save_to_database(item)  # Temporarily disable


Run with one URL to see how parse processes a single page.


Experiment Safely:

Use mock HTML (as shown above) to test without network requests.



Modify selectors (e.g., change div.product-card to div.item) to learn BeautifulSoup’s flexibility.

Ask Questions:

If unclear (e.g., why use SplashRequest?), ask for explanations.



Example: SplashRequest renders JavaScript, crucial for dynamic sites like Alibaba
